Software modules
================

One of the available options to manage software dependencies in Vision is through the use of software modules, which sets the paths for the necessary binaries, libraries, manuals and include files for the software needed by each application.

The management of these software modules in Vision is achived with the help of EasyBuild together with Lmod to load the modules. You can learn more about EasyBuild and Lmod in https://easybuild.io/ and https://lmod.readthedocs.io/.

You can learn more abot using software modules in :ref:`using_modules`. The list of the software modules available in Vision can be found in :ref:`software_list`.
