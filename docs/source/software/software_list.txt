    NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data
    formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.

  netCDF-C++4: netCDF-C++4/4.3.1
    NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data
    formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.

  netCDF-Fortran: netCDF-Fortran/4.5.2, netCDF-Fortran/4.5.3
    NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data

  nsync: nsync/1.24.0
    nsync is a C library that exports various synchronization primitives, such as mutexes

  numactl: numactl/2.0.13, numactl/2.0.14
    The numactl program allows you to run your application program on specific cpu's and memory
    nodes. It does this by supplying a NUMA memory policy to the operating system before running your
    program. The libnuma library provides convenient ways for you to add NUMA memory policies into
    your own program. 

  pkg-config: pkg-config/0.29.2
    pkg-config is a helper tool used when compiling applications and libraries. It helps you insert
    the correct compiler options on the command line so an application can use gcc -o test test.c
    `pkg-config --libs --cflags glib-2.0` for instance, rather than hard-coding values on where to
    find glib (or other libraries). 

  pkgconfig: pkgconfig/1.5.4-python
    pkgconfig is a Python module to interface with the pkg-config command line tool

  protobuf: protobuf/3.14.0, protobuf/3.17.3
    Google Protocol Buffers

  protobuf-python: protobuf-python/3.14.0, protobuf-python/3.17.3
    Python Protocol Buffers runtime library.

  pybind11: pybind11/2.6.0, pybind11/2.6.2
    pybind11 is a lightweight header-only library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa,
    mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++ code.

  rootless-docker: rootless-docker

  scikit-learn: scikit-learn/0.24.2
    Scikit-learn integrates machine learning algorithms in the tightly-knit scientific Python world,
    building upon numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. As a machine-learning module, it provides versatile
    tools for data mining and analysis in any field of science and engineering. It strives to be
    simple and efficient, accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts.

  snappy: snappy/1.1.8
    Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for maximum compression, or
    compatibility with any other compression library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and
    reasonable compression.

  tensorboard: tensorboard/2.8.0
    TensorBoard is a suite of web applications for inspecting and understanding your TensorFlow runs
    and graphs.

  typing-extensions: typing-extensions/3.7.4.3, typing-extensions/3.10.0.0
    Typing Extensions – Backported and Experimental Type Hints for Python

  util-linux: util-linux/2.35, util-linux/2.36
    Set of Linux utilities

  x264: x264/20201026, x264/20210414
    x264 is a free software library and application for encoding video streams into the H.264/MPEG-4
    AVC compression format, and is released under the terms of the GNU GPL. 

  x265: x265/3.3, x265/3.5
    x265 is a free software library and application for encoding video streams into the H.265 AVC
    compression format, and is released under the terms of the GNU GPL. 

  xorg-macros: xorg-macros/1.19.2, xorg-macros/1.19.3
    X.org macros utilities.

  zlib: zlib/1.2.11
    zlib is designed to be a free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered -- that is, not covered by
    any patents -- lossless data-compression library for use on virtually any computer hardware and
    operating system.

  zstd: zstd/1.4.5, zstd/1.4.9
    Zstandard is a real-time compression algorithm, providing high compression ratios. It offers a
    very wide range of compression/speed trade-off, while being backed by a very fast decoder. It
    also offers a special mode for small data, called dictionary compression, and can create
    dictionaries from any sample set.
